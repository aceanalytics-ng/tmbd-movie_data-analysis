This is my submission for the ALX-T Data Analyst Nanodegree Program's Data Investigation Project. 

## What this project is about: 
Welcome to this movies data investigation/analysis project. In this project, I seek to deepdive into TMDb dataset, and gain insights into how different movies produced over the years have been performing, and maybe observe some trends that may be used as a basis for certain recommendations and action plans. The dataset used contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb).

The analyses in this project will be guided by the followung research questions:

Which movie genres have been more popular over the years?
Who were the most engaged directors in the industry?
Which movies have been voted as most popular by viewers?
What are the Top 10 rated movies?
How have movie productions performed financially over the years?
What are the possible explanations for these performances?
